        <p>Rock Paper Scissors is a simple and fun game for two players. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The winner is determined by a straightforward set of rules: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock. If both players choose the same option, the round is a tie. The goal is to select the option that defeats your opponentâ€™s choice. Enjoy playing and may the best choice win!</p>
